# Random Forest Classification
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest Classification model using the HR_Dataset.csv.

## **Description**
This notebook walks through the process of:

1. Importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
2. Loading the HR dataset.
3. Encoding categorical data using OneHotEncoder.
4. Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
5. Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
6. Training a Random Forest Classification model.
7. Evaluating model performance using a Confusion Matrix and accuracy score.

## **Usage**
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the HR_Dataset.csv file is available in your repository.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to observe each step's output and analysis.
5. Customize the model by adjusting parameters, exploring different evaluation metrics, or using other datasets.

## **Files**
Random_Forest_Classification_Devansh Gupta.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
HR_Dataset.csv: Dataset used for modeling.

## **Results**
The Random Forest Classification model achieved the following results:

- **Confusion Matrix:**
```
[[2872    9]
 [  30  839]]
```
- **Accuracy Score: 98.96%**
